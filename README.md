# How to play
Word Bomber is a simple word typing game. Multiple words appear on the screen (moving downwards) from the top with some time interval between each other.
The player has to type the words correctly before they reach the bottom to earn points, else the player loses a life. The words appear in waves, with
the number of words increasing with each wave. After a certain number of lives are lost, the game ends. The player can choose to replay the game or quit.
